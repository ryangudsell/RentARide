## Contributors:
This project was for my JavaScript Intro assessment, this project’s purpose was to be able to rent and supply specific vehicles for journeying around New Zealand to customers based on the time of the trip, the distance of the trip, and the number of people meant to travel in the vehicle. I expanded my experience with Mapbox in this project by using the built-in directions feature, akin to Google Maps, to translate the time and distance the trip will take and calculate costs accordingly (with fuel and other costs in mind).
## Technologies Used
- Mapbox was used in this project to visually show the users the start and end of their journey, with all the roads and towns in mind to correctly calculate fuel cost, travel time, and total road distance.
- Google Fonts was used in this project to source the main font “Lato” and all of its styles in order to create variation between different text types while keeping as much consistency as possible.
- Bootstrap Icons were used as well to provide icons where I believed it would best serve the users, visually, in terms of accessibility and to improve the user flow of the design.

## My Role
As the sole developer, I was in charge of research, design, justification, prototype development, and development of the final build. This also includes a website proposal for the client and full documentation detailing the start to finish of the project.
## Key Takeaways
From this project, I took away the importance of testing and error prevention. Almost all inputs broke at some point in the project. The custom date fields had to be managed independently as well as manual error catching for the passenger count input, as this input determined what vehicles were barred from the user. The address generation for Mapbox was also difficult to work with as I had to read and understand the documentation for the API to fix the issues I developed during the final few days of the project. If I were to test these more, I would have saved a lot of time and stress.
